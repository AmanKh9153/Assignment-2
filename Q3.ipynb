The words appearing at the beginning of any sentense suffers most from this problem, and the `words_list` obtained from '`nltk` also contains words with mixed cases.<br>**Solution:** To resolve this issue, it is a common practice to convert all words of dictonary to lower cases and then append into bloom filter, and before any processing on the reviews, we need to convert the whole review in lower case.\n",
